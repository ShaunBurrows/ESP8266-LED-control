Control LEDs (or strips) with the ESP8266, web-server on ESP8266 using websockets

Modifed (thanks to) https://github.com/tttapa/ESP8266/tree/master/Examples/14.%20WebSocket/A-WebSocket_LED_control
(Didn't want to fork entire project for one example.)

Control adressible RGB LEDs/strips, with start condisions for each strip.

A webserver is started on the ESP8266 to deliver a webpage with controls for each strip.

Plan to add music control and "party effects".
